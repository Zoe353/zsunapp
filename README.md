## A new Workers project using Wrangler.   
This project will respond to two kinds of requests:  
* one, to generate a JSON API (defined below), 
* second, to serve an HTML page (see "Set up an HTML page")    

Implemented page: https://zsunapp.zoey353.workers.dev/  
Notes: the general requirments and the extra credits are both implemented.
